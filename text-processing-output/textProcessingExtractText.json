How is an author’s copyright status determined? \n \n \n1. How can I register my conference to use the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form? \nIEEE Publication Volunteers should go to the registration web page at \nhttp://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/ecf_registration.html to begin the \nprocess of setting up their site.  \n \n2. If I registered a conference to use the eCF last year, do I need to reregister for this year’s \nconference? \nYes, it is necessary for each publication title to be registered in order to ensure the eCF system will \nrecognize and accept incoming data from your conference submission system.  You may reuse a source \ncode assigned to your conference, but we prefer to use a new code for each year.  Please contact the \nIPR Office at ecopyright@ieee.org if you have any problems with using a source code for more than one \npublication title.  \n \n\n3. What is the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form? \nThe IEEE eCF is a fully digital version of the IEEE Copyright Form.  It includes an important feature (the \nWizard) that, through a series of questions and replies, determines the author’s copyright status and \nbrings the author to the appropriate Form to sign. \n \n4. How does this Electronic Copyright Form work? \nYou begin by responding to the interactive Wizard, which was designed to be very simple and \nconvenient. After you’ve finished answering the Wizard’s easy questions, you will be transferred a \npublication agreement that is based on your needs.  Once you’ve read the information on the \nagreement, and confirmed that it is the correct agreement for you, all you need to do is type in your \nname and date in the boxes at the bottom.  Once you click on the “Submit” button, the process will be \ncompleted, and you will automatically receive a copy of the signed agreement via email. \n \n5. How do I “sign” the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form? \nSimply by typing your name at the proper location.   \n \n6. Does a typed name carry the same legal weight as a handwritten signature? \nYes.  Until the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-Sign”) was signed into law \nin 2000, we were required to obtain a handwritten signature on all copyright transfer forms.  The E-Sign \nAct now gives an electronically signed form the same legal effect as that of an original, hand-signed \ndocument. \n \n7. Don’t you need to use a higher level of security, such as digital certificates or encryption \nkeys? \nIf this were a transaction between financial institutions, involving large sums of money, then we’d \ncertainly be using such technology.  Given the relatively modest status of this kind of transaction, it \nwould be overkill to employ so much security.   \n \n8. What about authentication? \nThe only way to get to the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form is if you’ve already been authenticated \nthrough at least one identification process. \n \n9. What if I am not authorized to sign the Form? \nIf you know that you are not in an authorized position to sign the IEEE Copyright Form, or if a co-author \nof your paper should sign instead of you, be sure to select “I am NOT authorized to sign the publication \nagreement.”  Fill in the name and email address of the person who is authorized to sign the agreement.  \nOnce you submit this information, the person you’ve identified will receive an email with a link to the \neCF system.  The person will be able to complete and sign the publication agreement. \n \n \n \n\n10. How do I access the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form? \nThe IEEE eCF is only available though an IEEE journal or conference that has registered to use the eCF.  \nPlease check with the Editor-In-Chief of the journal, or the Publication Chair of the conference to find \nout if the eCF is available to submitting authors. \n \n11. What should I do if the link that I received to access the eCF does not work? \nYou will need to contact the IEEE IPR Office at ecopyright@ieee.org and provide more information.  \nPlease submit a question, and include the link and login credentials you received by email. \n \n12. What should I do if I receive an error message during the process of completing the \nelectronic copyright form? \nPlease try to electronically submit your IEEE Copyright Form again.  Your session could have expired.  If it \nstill does not work, please try from a computer in a different location, because there could be firewall \nissues at the network you are using.  If you try these alternatives and still have a problem, you could \nprint out a hard copy of the IEEE Copyright Form, hand-sign it, scan it, then email a copy of the copyright \nform to the publication.  Please send it to the same people to whom you have submitted your paper. \n \n13. What if I make a mistake while trying to complete the eCF? \nThere is a “Back” button at the bottom of each page that can be clicked on at any time during the \nprocess. \n \n14. What should I do if my electronic copyright form does not include all the coauthors of the \npaper? \nAuthor names can be modified, added, or deleted during the eCF process.  If an author is added or \nremoved after the eCF has been submitted, this will not be a problem as far as IEEE is concerned.  As \nsoon as we have a copy of the signed agreement in our database, we will consider the requirement \nfulfilled and finished.  Any changes to the authors name or listing must be conveyed to the editor or \nconference publication chair. \n \n \n15. What should I do if the title of my paper is incorrect on my electronic copyright form? \nPaper titles can be modified during the eCF process.  The modified title only affects the publication \nagreement.  Any changes to the paper title must be conveyed to the editor or conference publication \nchair. \n \n16. What should I do if I successfully completed the electronic copyright form and did not \nreceive a confirmation email? \nPlease contact the IEEE IPR Office at ecopyright@ieee.org to confirm that your eCF was submitted \ncorrectly.  If the eCF was received successfully, the IPR Office staff will be able to send you a \nconfirmation email along with a PDF receipt for your records. \n \n17. What exactly is copyright?  \nCopyright is one of a group of intellectual property rights (or laws) that are intended to protect the \ninterests of an author or copyright owner. These laws give an author/owner nearly exclusive control \nover the use of his/her work.  In particular, copyright protects the specific expression of an idea (e.g., \n\nthe specific wording of your text) but not the idea itself.  Copyright comes into existence the moment a \nwork (an article, a book, a computer program, an email, a symphony, a sculpture, etc.) is first fixed in \nany tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which it can be perceived, \nreproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. \n \n18. How is an author’s copyright status determined? \nThe author’s copyright status is determined to a large extent by the type of employer for whom the \nauthor works.  For example, if you are employed by the U.S. Government, and you are the sole author of \nyour paper, then you should sign the “IEEE Copyright Form for U.S. Government Employees.”  If you are \nemployed by the U.S. Government, but your coauthors are in private industry, then one of your \ncoauthors should complete the Wizard and sign the IEEE Copyright Form.  If you are the sole author and \nyou are employed by a Crown Government (or if you and your coauthors are Crown government \nemployees), then copyright to your paper will remain with the Crown government.  You will \nconsequently be asked to sign the “IEEE Copyright Form for Works Subject to Crown Copyright.”  \nHowever, if you are employed by a Crown government, but your coauthor is in private industry, then \nyour coauthor should complete the Wizard and sign the IEEE Copyright Form. \n "
