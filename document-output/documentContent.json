The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people’s\nmental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners\n(e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations.\nWe sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online\nEcological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated\nword frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford\nhappiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected\ndata. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences\nin the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020.  The results\nshowed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social\nrisks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction\ndecreased.  People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure\nand friends.   The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in\npsychological conditions after the outbreak.  It may provide references for policy makers to plan\nand fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently\nprepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and\naffected people.\nKeywords:public health emergencies; word frequency analysis; mental health; emotion; cognition\n1. Introduction\nCOVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is a highly infectious disease with a long incubation period\nwhich was caused by Sars-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) [1]. The number\nof COVID-19 patients increased dramatically due to hundreds of millions of people traveling during\nthe Spring Festival period.  The severity of COVID-19 had been underestimated until the National\nHealth Commission classified it as a B type infectious disease officially and took actions to fight against\nthis disease on 20 January, 2020. Ever since then, epidemic prevention was comprehensively upgraded\nand marked the real beginning of universal concern, indicating widespread impacts.\nThe uncertainty and low predictability of COVID-19 not only threaten people’s physical health,\nbut also affect people’s mental health, especially in terms of emotions and cognition, as many theories\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 2032; doi:10.3390/ijerph17062032www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 20322 of 9\nindicate. According to Behavioral Immune System (BIS) theory [2], people are likely to develop negative\nemotions (e.g., aversion, anxiety, etc.) [3,4] and negative cognitive assessment [5,6] for self-protection.\nFaced with potential disease threat, people tend to develop avoidant behaviors (e.g., avoid contact with\npeople who have pneumonia-like symptoms) [7] and obey social norms strictly (e.g., conformity) [8].\nAccording to stress theory [9] and perceived risk theory [10], public health emergencies trigger more\nnegative emotions and affect cognitive assessment as well.  These negative emotions keep people\naway from potential pathogens when it refers to the disease. However, long-term negative emotions\nmay reduce the immune function of people and destroy the balance of their normal physiological\nmechanisms [11].  Meanwhile, individuals may overreact to any disease in case of less appropriate\nguidance from authorities, which may result in excessively avoidant behaviors and blind conformity [8].\nTherefore, it is essential to understand the potential psychological changes caused by COVID-19 in\na timely manner. Since psychological changes caused by public health emergencies can be reflected\ndirectly in emotions and cognition [3–6], we can monitor psychological changes in time through\nemotional (e.g., negative emotions and positive emotions) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk\njudgment and life satisfaction).\nThe emotions and cognition are usually measured by retrospective questionnaires, such as Oxford\nHappiness Inventory (OHI) [12], Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) [13], Satisfaction with Life Scale\n(SWLS) [14], and Likert Type Attitude Scale [15,16]. However, at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in\nChina, it was very difficult to conduct a traditional paper survey in the affected areas; online surveys\nrely on the cooperation of participants, and it is difficult to meet the requirements in time, and even\nbrings extra burdens for participants. Since we did not know the time of COVID-19 declaration, it was\nimpossible to measure people’s emotions and cognition by a traditional survey in advance. There may\nbe a certain deviation when requiring people to recall their mental state a week or more ago. Weibo\ndata is emerging as a key online medium and data source for researchers to understand this social\nproblem in a non-invasive way. Sina Weibo is a leading Chinese Online Social Networks (OSN) with\nmore than 462 million active daily users in 2019. These users use Weibo functions (e.g., reply, @function)\nto interact with each other, forming rich user behavior data.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the impacts of public health emergency COVID-19 on people’s\nmental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners\n(e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide services to affected populations in time.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Participants and Data Collection\nThe samples in this study were from the original Weibo data pool [17]. The data pool contained\nmore than 1.16 million active Weibo users. Weibo is a popular platform to share and discuss individual\ninformation and life activities, as well as celebrity news in China [18].\nThe retrieved data included (1) user’s profile information, (2) network behaviors, and (3) Weibo\nmessages. Privacy was strictly protected during the procedure, referring to the ethical principles [19].\nWe have obtained the Ethical Committee’s approval and the ethic code is H15009.\nThe following inclusion criteria were employed to select active Weibo users from the data pool.\nFirst, they had published at least 50 original Weibo posts around a month in total from 31 December,\n2019 to 26 January, 2020. Second, their authentication type is non-institutional (e.g., individual user,\netc.). Third, their regional authentication is in China, not “overseas” or “other”.\nWe acquired 17,865 active Weibo users finally, then fetched all their original posts published\nduring 13 January, 2020 to 26 January, 2020 into the two-week period for the analysis.\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 20323 of 9\n2.2. Measurement of Psychological Traits and Procedures\nIn this study, we used Online Ecological Recognition (OER) [20], which referred to the automatic\nrecognition of psychological profile (e.g., anxiety, well-being, etc.) by using predictive models [17,20,21]\nbased on ecological behavioral data from Weibo.\nWe employed Text Mind system developed by the Computational Cyber Psychology Laboratory\nat the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to extract content features [22], including\nChinese word segmentation tool [17], and psychoanalytic dictionary [23]. We used the Chinese word\nsegmentation tool to divide users’ original microblog content into words/phrases with linguistic\nannotations, such as verbs, nouns, adverbials, and objects [24], and then extracted psychologically\nmeaningful categories through the simplified Chinese LIWC (Language Inquiry and Word Count)\ndictionary [23]. These lexical features were data sources for word frequency analysis.\nAfter feature extraction, we used the psychological prediction model [25] obtained from the\npreliminary training to predict the psychological profile of these active Weibo users. These predictive\nmodels are tools developed for online psychology research based on big data and deep learning\ntechnologies, including emotional indicators (anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness),\ncognitive indicators (social risk judgment and life satisfaction), and so on.   Figure 1 portrays the\nprocedure from feature extraction to psychological indicator prediction.  All the prediction models\nhave reached a moderate correlation with questionnaire scores. The feasibility of predictive models\nhas been repeatedly demonstrated [26–28].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x 3 of 9 \n \n \n2.2.

Linguistic Difference\nIn this study, we compare the LIWC categories between the week before (T-before) and after\n(T-after) 20 January, shown in Table 2. It contains two types of LIWC categories: words of emotions and\nwords of concerns. Words of emotions include positive emotion (e.g., faith, contentment, and blessing),\nnegative emotion (e.g., worry, suspicion, and jealousy), anxiety (e.g., upset, nervous, and crazy), and\nanger (e.g., complaint). Words of concerns include health (e.g., insomnia, doctor, and exercise), leisure\n(e.g., cooking, chatting, and movies), family (e.g., family and house), friend (e.g., companion and\nguest), money (e.g., bills, cash, and borrowing), death (e.g., burial, killing, and funeral), and religion\n(e.g., church, mosque, and temple), which can reflect what people are paying attention to.\nTable 2.Word frequency analysis before and after 20 January.\nT-BeforeT-After\nt\ndf\np\nMSDMSD\nWords of emotions\nPositive\nemotion\n2.581.462.861.47−24.41117,7470.000 ***\nNegative\nemotion\n0.710.630.790.59−15.27317,7470.000 ***\nAnxiety0.090.170.120.17−15.29417,7470.000 ***\nAnger0.190.260.190.23−0.34717,7470.792\nWords of concerns\nHealth0.370.430.720.63−72.39217,7470.000 ***\nLeisure1.771.281.601.1921.96317,7470.000 ***\nFamily0.220.300.250.30−12.57117,7470.000 ***\nFriend0.110.200.100.166.20217,7470.000 ***\nMoney0.710.770.710.751.35317,7470.176\nDeath0.140.270.150.24−6.70717,7470.000 ***\nReligion0.280.460.320.45−13.81617,7470.000 ***\nT-before represents the word frequency during 13–19 January, 2020; T-after represents the word frequency during\n20–26 January, 2020; M=mean; SD=standard deviation; df=degrees of freedom. ***p<0.001.\nAfter 20 January, the number of words increased in positive emotion (t(17,747)=−24.411,p<0.001),\nnegative emotion (t(17,747)=−15.273,p<0.001), and anxiety (t(17,747)=−15.294,p<0.001).

Discussion\nSince the National Health Commission identified COVID-19 as a B type infectious disease officially,\nCOVID-19 influenced the psychological states of people across China.  This study collected active\nWeibo users’ data, and conducted sentiment analysis during 13–26 January, 2020.  We used OER to\nacquire the psychological states, and found that Weibo users’ psychological conditions significantly\nchanged under the outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe findings showed that people’s concerns by linguistic expression increased after January 20.\nWe observe an increase in health and family, while a decrease in leisure and friend.  Uncertainty of\nthe upcoming situation causes cognitive dissonance and insecurity; this produces a feeling of mental\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 20326 of 9\ndiscomfort, leading to Weibo’s activity oriented toward dissonance reduction and keeping security on\nhealth and family relationship [29]. According to the theory of BIS, people behave in a more reticent\nand conservative way when they feel threatened by disease [30].  Therefore, staying at home with\nfamily and reducing recreational activities seems to be a safer way to prevent illness. It also indicated\nthat people begin to care more about their health and were more likely to seek social support from\ntheir families rather than getting together with friends, which suggested that people’ interests and\nattention were influenced by the restricted travel policy and self-isolation regulations from the health\nauthorities and central government.\nAffected by COVID-19, messages related to death and religion became salient after 20 January.\nReports showed severity and potential mortality of COVID-19. Research confirmed that people tended\nto respond to emergencies such as stress or death in the way of religion, which can comfort tense\nmoods and bring more positive emotions [31].  That is why people prayed for the county through\nreligion or other beliefs, leading to the phrase that appeared most frequently on the Internet at that\ntime: God bless China.\nPeople showed more negative emotions (anxiety, depression, and indignation) and less positive\nemotions (Oxford happiness) after the declaration of COVID-19, which was supported by the theory\nof BIS, i.e., people did generate more negative emotions for self-protection [3,4].  These results are\nconsistent  to  previous  studies  as  well,  which  found  that  public  health  emergencies  (e.g.,  SARS)\ntriggered a series of stress emotional response containing a higher level of anxiety and other negative\nemotions [32,33]. Meanwhile, the confirmation that COVID-19 could be passed from person to person\non 20 January, which was inconsistent with previous reports, lead to quite a number of people being\nunsatisfied with misinformation published from provincial governments (e.g., Hubei) and ineffective\nregulatory actions, causing an increase in indignation.  However, it’s worth noting that the word\nfrequency of positive emotions increased after 20 January, which seemed to be inconsistent with the\ntheory of BIS. In fact, positive emotion includes words such as faith and blessing, which are more\ninclined to reflect group cohesiveness rather than pure personal emotions (e.g., happiness). Researchers\nfound that group threats (e.g., natural disasters and epidemic diseases) made groups a community of\ninterests, resulting in more beneficial behaviors and social solidarity, which indicated higher group\ncohesiveness [34].  For example, lots of provinces (e.g., Sichuan Province, Shandong Province, etc.)\nformed medical teams to help the Hubei province, which was the worst affected area. Many people\ndonated money and supplies to Hubei Red Cross to support the control of COVID-19.\nFurthermore, social risk judgement was higher and life satisfaction was lower after the declaration\nof COVID-19. It is consistent with the theory of BIS, which found that when social uncertainty increased,\nsuch as unknown etiology and ambiguous route of transmission, people developed the negative\ncognitive assessment (e.g., higher sensitivity of risk judgment or risk perception) so that they could\ndiscover potential infection sources in time and avoid infection [2,35]. Not only that, people’s fear of\npotential risk and lack of controllability caused by COVID-19 brought about higher risk judgement as\nperceived risk theory claimed [10]. Moreover, some preventive policies and regulations in terms of\ntravel restriction and self-isolation made the quality of life worse, reflecting in lower life satisfaction.\nThe following briefly foregrounds some of the study’s implications for policy makers and clinical\npractitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) plan and fight against COVID-19.\nFor policy makers: (1) develop a consistent policy and procedure for reporting the latest confirmed\ncases, recent death toll, and other data about the epidemic situation. For example, the surge of cases on\nFebruary 12th did not mean that the situation has been out of control, but because of the new diagnostic\ncriteria introduced.  It is important to let people understand the data properly to reduce excessive\nstress responses (e.g., anxiety, depression, etc.) brought on by inappropriate perception. (2) Expand\npublic awareness of continuous progress in decision-making measures. Since indignation may come\nmainly from mistakes and deficiencies in preventing and controlling the epidemic, it can effectively\ndecrease indignation if public awareness and involvement are provided.  (3) Ensure the supply of\nmedical treatment service.  It is critical to set up medical service to treat the disease, and let people\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 20327 of 9\nknow how to access it conveniently. People can get help in time if they are infected. It can improve\npeople’s sense of control over risks, thereby avoiding excessive social risk perception. (4) Provide more\nin-door entertainment services to address good quality of life. People may be more willing to cooperate\nwhen their living and entertainment requirements are met, such as online shopping, entertainments,\netc.   For  clinical  practitioners:  (1)  adjust  consultant  configuration  rationally  and  cooperate  with\neach other. Psychological consultants should grasp the epidemic information correctly and conduct\nscience popularization during counseling.  Social workers can help solve practical problems in life.\nThese actions can improve the sense of stability and relieve anxiety and depression.   (2) Deliver\nnecessary psychosocial therapy in various ways. Considering the particularity of self-isolation, relevant\nhotline counseling and online consulting should be applied in practice.\nSeveral other points should be considered when generalizing this study’s findings. First, as Weibo\nusers are mainly young people, the results may be biased to some extent.  In addition, the current\nanalysis is based on a weekly basis, with a relatively large granularity, which has certain influences on\nreflecting the changing trend of social mentality in a timely manner.  In further studies, we will try\nto expand the range of sex and age and predict psychological traits in a finer granularity.  Previous\nstudies indicated that people tended to exaggerate attitudes and prejudices, especially when they\nfelt more vulnerable to disease transmission [36].  It inspires us to try to build a prediction model\nwhich can predict people’s attitudes and beliefs against the virus through online Weibo data for further\nunderstanding of psychological impacts of public health emergencies.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we compared the difference before and after 20 January on both linguistic categories\nand psychological profile.   We found an increase in negative emotions (anxiety,  depression,  and\nindignation) and sensitivity to social risks, as well as a decrease in positive emotions (Oxford happiness)\nand life satisfaction after declaration of COVID-19 in China. What’s more, people show more concern\nfor health and family, and less concern for leisure and friends. Using social media data may provide\ntimely understanding of the impact of public health emergencies on the public’s mental health during\nthe epidemic period.\nAuthor Contributions:S.L., N.Z., and T.Z. conceived and planned this article.
